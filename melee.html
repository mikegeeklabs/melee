  <h4>MELEE</h4>
  <p>As defined: Melee - a confused mass of people. "the melee of people that was always thronging the streets"</p>
  <p>Mailing Engine List Engine: A very small mailing list manager writen from scratch
  for small to moderate sized mailing lists. 2 to 1000+ people. A sharable version will
  be posted to <a href="https://github.com/mikegeeklabs/melee">GitHub</a> soon.
  Written in PHP (7.3+) the entire system including web management and css is
  currently less than 2MB. It currently requires a single MariaDB/MySQL table for member
  management, a working SMTP and IMAP server. Unlike legacy mailing list
  managers and mailing engines, Melee receives from an standard IMAP account, and
  emails via a standard SMTP server. Configuration is via editing a single config file.
  </p>
  <p>Currently, all administrative functions are CLI and SQL, but a seperate admin web interface is in the works.</p>
