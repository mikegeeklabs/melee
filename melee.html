  <h4>MELEE</h4>
  <p>As defined: Melee - a confused mass of people. "the melee of people that was always thronging the streets"</p>
  <p>Mailing Engine List Engine: A very small mailing list manager writen from scratch
  for small to moderate sized mailing lists. 2 to 1000+ people. 
  Written in PHP (7.3+) the entire system including web management and css is
  currently less than 2MB. Melee requires a single MariaDB/MySQL table for member
  management and a working SMTP and IMAP server. Unlike legacy mailing list
  managers and mailing engines, Melee receives from an standard IMAP account, and
  emails via a standard SMTP server. Configuration is via editing a single config file.
  </p>
  <p>Currently, all administrative functions are CLI and SQL, but a seperate admin web interface is in the works.</p>
  <p>Created by Mike Harrison of <a href="https://www.geeklabs.com">GeekLabs.com</A>
  for <A HREF="https://chugalug.org">Chugalug</A>, who struggled to maintain it
  as a sharable project at: <a href="https://github.com/mikegeeklabs/melee">GitHub</a>. </p><p>
  <i>The struggle comes from Mike's bad habits of editing code in production and hard coding things that should be config variables.</i>.
